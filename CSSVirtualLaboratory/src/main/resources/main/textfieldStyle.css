<blur-type> = [ gaussian | one-pass-box | three-pass-box | two-pass-box ]
<color> The shadow Color.
<number> The radius of the shadow blur kernel. In the range [0.0 ... 127.0], typical value 10.
<number> The spread of the shadow. The spread is the portion of the radius where the contribution of the source material will be 100%. The remaining portion of the radius will have a contribution controlled by the blur kernel. A spread of 0.0 will result in a distribution of the shadow determined entirely by the blur algorithm. A spread of 1.0 will result in a solid growth outward of the source material opacity to the limit of the radius with a very sharp cutoff to transparency at the radius. Values should be in the range [0.0 ... 1.0].
<number> The shadow offset in the x direction, in pixels.
<number> The shadow offset in the y direction, in pixels.
